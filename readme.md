## Integrated Design of Physical Structure and Controller


## Description

The repository contains an implementation of the paper "An Approach to Integrated Design of Physical Structure and Controller Based on Galerkin Approximations of Hamilton-Jacobi Equation" submitted to the 2023 International Symposium on Nonlinear Theory and Its Applications (NOLTA2023).

## How to run

Requisite: MATLAB & Symbolic Math Toolbox

To perform simulation, run `main_nolta2023.m'.

To plot the value of objective function, run `plot_iteration.m'.

To plot phase portrait of the closed-loop system, run `plot_phase_portrait.m'.
